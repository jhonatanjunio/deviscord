# Deviscord

A Discord bot made from a web developer to web developers! The goal is to challenge your skills about the basics (or even the advanced stuff!)

## Features

- You can define a routine that launches random quizes about web development directly to your Discord server! With a few steps your bot will challenge the members based on the difficulty and subjects you define! You can read more at [https://quizapi.io/docs/1.0/overview](https://quizapi.io/docs/1.0/overview).
- There is a leveling system implemented to as well a ranking system! Show your users the best among them. You can change the "title" based on how fast the users answers the quizes. Use the command `/profile` while your bot is running to flex ðŸ˜Ž

## TODOs
  - There is nothing done regarding the translation. Bot responses are all in Brazilian Portuguese.
  - Code documentation is poor.
  - Tests are not implemented too.
  - Visual interface for a better admin experience.

That's all!
Now you just have to run your server loccally or deploy it to somewhere you want, and you're ready to go.
Enjoy! <br/><br/>
